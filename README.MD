# 2048 Game Project

This project is an implementation of the popular game 2048, developed as a mandatory assignment for the Technological University of Uruguay. The goal of this project is to mimic the functionality of the original 2048 game, with certain restrictions introduced by the professor.

## Project Restrictions

The project was developed under the following constraints:

1. Only functions covered in the course could be used.
